## Synopsis
This is my attempt to reverse engineer the Youngandhungry.co website. Instead of creating the website like Youngandhungry, I used CSS Flexbox.

## Motivation
The responsiveness of Youngandhungry's website inspired me to see if I could create something similar to what they've accomplished on their own website.
Also, in learning SASS, CSS, jQuery, and HTML5, I wanted to create a website that would be challening, and push my understanding of fundamental concepts for any Front End Developer.

## Contributors
I reverse engineered this website completely myself. However I would not have been able to complete the assignment if it weren't for the assistance I found on CodePen and Stackoverflow.
