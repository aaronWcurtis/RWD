## Synopsis
This is my attempt to reverse engineer the fla.it website. Instead of creating the website like fla.it, I used CSS Flexbox.
I have swapped out their image content with other images that I have found on Google.

## Motivation
The responsiveness of fla.it's website inspired me to see if I could create something similar to what they've accomplished on their own website.
Also, in learning SASS, CSS, jQuery, and HTML5, I wanted to create a website that would be challening, and push my understanding of fundamental concepts for any Front End Developer.

## Contributors
I reverse engineered this website completely myself. However I would not have been able to complete the assignment without the help of the amazing Developer community on Youtube and the https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ website which gives a great breakdown of flexbox that I refer to a lot.
