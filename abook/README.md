## Synopsis
I reverse engineered another website using Flexbox in order to practice making responsive webpages.

## Motivation
The responsiveness of the original site inspired me to see if I could create something similar to what they've accomplished.
Also, in learning SASS, CSS, jQuery, and HTML5, I wanted to create a website that would be challening, and push my understanding of fundamental concepts for any Front End Developer.

## Contributors
I reverse engineered this website completely myself. However I would not have been able to complete the assignment if it weren't for the assistance of the article on CSS Tricks called A Complete Guide to Flexbox by Chris Coyier.
